# Uploading Files Using the Github UI

If you prefer the flow of downloading and uploading files/folders like an FTP server, the Github website recreates a lot of the features users are used to with FTP.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository, or go here: [https://github.com/htincentives/trips.htincentives.com].
2. Above the list of files, using the **Add file** drop-down, click **Upload files**. !["Upload files" in the "Add file" dropdown](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-26342/images/help/repository/upload-files-button.png)
3. Drag and drop the file or folder you'd like to upload to your repository onto the file tree. ![Drag and drop area](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-10159/images/help/repository/upload-files-drag-and-drop.png)
4. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
5. Click **Commit changes**. ![Commit changes button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-19765/images/help/repository/commit-changes-button.png)

## Tips

* Files that you add to a repository via a browser are limited to 25 MB per file. You can add larger files, up to 100 MB each, via the command line. For more information, see "[Adding a file to a repository using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository?platform=mac#adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line)." To add files larger than 100 MB, you must use Git Large File Storage. For more information, see "[About large files on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)."
* You can upload multiple files to GitHub at the same time.
