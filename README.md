## Updating files

Files that you add to a repository via a browser are limited to 25 MB per file. You can add larger files, up to 100 MB each, via the command line. For more information, see "[Adding a file to a repository using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository?platform=mac#adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line)." To add files larger than 100 MB, you must use Git Large File Storage. For more information, see "[About large files on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)."

**Tips:**

-   You can upload multiple files to GitHub at the same time.
-   If a repository has any protected branches, you can't edit or upload files in the protected branch using GitHub. For more information, see "[About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches)."

1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2.  Above the list of files, using the **Add file** drop-down, click **Upload files**. !["Upload files" in the "Add file" dropdown](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-26342/images/help/repository/upload-files-button.png)
3.  Drag and drop the file or folder you'd like to upload to your repository onto the file tree. ![Drag and drop area](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-10159/images/help/repository/upload-files-drag-and-drop.png)
4.  At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "[Creating a commit with multiple co-authors](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)." ![Commit message for your change](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-9378/images/help/repository/write-commit-message-quick-pull.png)
5.  Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "[Creating a new pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)." ![Commit branch options](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-32137/images/help/repository/choose-commit-branch.png)
6.  Click **Commit changes**. ![Commit changes button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-19765/images/help/repository/commit-changes-button.png)
